## Summary

In this sprint you will follow steps in a similar fashion to movie list but with less guidance and more FULL STACK!!!

## Goals

FRONTEND
1. Create Client and Server folders to separate your work
2. Create a working front end picture grabber with REACT
3. Download some pictures into a local file to grab with your REACT app
4. Create dynamic REACT buttons that allow you to select whether you want a cat or dog photo
5. Create an upload file button that stores files in your local picture file


BACKEND
1. Create a NODE server
2. Create a mysql schema that will allow you to save pictures with name, species and owner properties
3. Create an upload button that allows you to attach name and owner properties to the uploaded picture
4. Create a mysql server and attach it to your node server with your schema
5. Finish wiring up your NODE server to your mysql server

FULL STACK
1. Connect your front end buttons (upload, catgrab & doggrab) up to your server. 
2. Create a server log-in system and don't give out cat photos to non-admins. 
3. Giving out dog photos to non-admins is okay as they could use a friend.

ADVANCED
1. Create a search function that will allow you to get a dog or cat photo only of a specific breed or owner.
